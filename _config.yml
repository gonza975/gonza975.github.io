  Hello, my name is Rafael and I am a senior in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Since I took a basic circuits class in middle school I have been fascinated with
  anything related to electronics. Programming is also something I enjoy, especially because the first cricuits I ever built used an Arduino microcontroller, which runs c++ programs. 
  Currently, I am a Validation Engineering Intern and I couldn't be happier because it is a mixture of circuits and programming.
